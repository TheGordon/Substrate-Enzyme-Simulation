# Substrate-Enzyme-Simulation

This project simulates the reaction kinetics of the reaction between an engineered leaf-branch compost cutinase and various polymers using the following differential equations

The dS/dt and dP/dt represent the substrate and product over time differential equations, respectively.

It then optimizes the actual data results to the model to find the most representative kinetic values.
